# My Repo

I'm Kurtis Oosterhof, Python Developer currently (as of writing) looking for work. The point of this repository is that I realized after finishing my degree, I was an idiot for not keeping the code for my projects. I'm working on exercises and small projects to make up for that, and it'll be found here! Most of the code will be in Python for now as that's the language I'm focusing on most, but I intend to practice/refresh myself on other technologies in the near future as well.

## A work in progress

As mentioned, I realized when I began looking for my next Software Development job that I was an idiot for not keeping any of the code from my school projects and exercises. As I do practice exercises and small projects, I'll be adding them here in an effort to build up some semblance of a portfolio. Once I think there's enough relevant material I'll set up a website portfolio for interactivity, and overhaul this repo to be more of the raw code exhibition, but for now this is what it is.

## The Folders

Any larger projects will have their own folders listed here. I have a couple projects in mind that I'm starting design on but haven't begun coding for yet. I expect to have the beginnings of one up here by the end of this week (2019-04-12).

### Exercises

This folder will have small exercises or mini practice projects from websites such as [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/), small projects from online courses, or other exercises/small projects as I come up with them. For something like Kattis, which has a large collection of problems with difficulty ratings, there will be a subfolder named Kattis (or whatever website it is) with an intuitive internal naming scheme or set of subfolders (depending on implementation) in place to sort the problems by listed difficulty. 

### Troy

Troy is the temporary name for this project. This project is a full Dungeons & Dragons character management tool. Features including but not limited to: character creation, inventory management, combat management, spell books, and various small resources and tools to help manage your character during the gameplay. For full project details, see the README in the folder.
